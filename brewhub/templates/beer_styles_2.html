Low floral, spicy, or herbal hop flavor optional, but is rarely strong enough to detect. Low to very low bitterness.

        <div class="history"><h5>History</h5><p>Coors briefly made a light lager in the early 1940s. Modern versions were first produced by Rheingold in 1967 to appeal to diet-conscious drinkers, but only became popular starting in 1973 after Miller Brewing acquired the recipe and marketed the beer heavily to sports fans with the “tastes great, less filling” campaign. Beers of this genre became the largest sellers in the United States in the 1990s.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class="ingredients"><h5>Characteristic Ingredients</h5><p>Two- or six-row barley with up to 40% rice or corn as adjuncts. Additional enzymes can further lighten the body and lower carbohydrates. Lager yeast. Negligible hops.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class="style-comparison"><h5>Style Comparison</h5><p>A lighter-bodied, lower-alcohol, lower calorie version of an American Lager. Less hop character and bitterness than a German Leichtbier.</p>

A broad category of international mass-market lagers ranging from up-scale American lagers to the typical “import” or “green bottle” international beers found in America and many export markets.

        <div class="overall-impression"><h5>Overall Impression</h5><p>A smooth, easily-drinkable, malty amber lager with a flavorful caramel or toast character. Usually fairly well-attenuated, often with an adjunct quality and restrained bitterness.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class="appearance"><h5>Appearance</h5><p>Golden-amber to reddish-copper color. Bright clarity. White to off-white foam stand which may not last.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class="aroma"><h5>Aroma</h5><p>Low to moderate grainy malt aroma often with very low to moderate caramel or toasty malt accents. Occasionally, nutty or biscuity, but never roasty. Low, unobtrusive floral or spicy hop aroma. Clean fermentation profile.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class="flavor"><h5>Flavor</h5><p>Low to moderate malt flavor, often with caramel or toasty-bready flavors. Low to medium-low corny sweetness optional. Low to moderate bitterness, giving the beer a malty to fairly even balance. Low to moderate spicy, herbal, or floral hop flavor. Clean fermentation profile. The finish is moderately dry with a moderately malty aftertaste. The beer may seem a touch sweet if the bitterness level is low.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class="mouthfeel"><h5>Mouthfeel</h5><p>Light to medium body. Medium to high carbonation. Smooth. Some examples can be slightly creamy.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class="comments"><h5>Comments</h5><p>A wide spectrum of mass-market amber lagers either developed independently in various countries, or describing rather generic amber beers with more historical relevance that eventually changed into indistinguishable products in modern times.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class="history"><h5>History</h5><p>Varies by country, but generally represents either an adaptation of the mass-market International Pale Lager, or an evolution of indigenous styles into more generic products.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class="ingredients"><h5>Characteristic Ingredients</h5><p>Two-row or six-row base malt. Color malts such as Victory, amber, or roast. May be all malt or use adjuncts. Sugars or coloring agents possible. Caramel malt. European or American hops.</p>
        </div><br/>
        <div class="style-comparison"><h5>Style Comparison</h5><p>Less well-developed malt flavor than a Vienna Lager, often with an adjunct taste. Less robust flavor and bitterness than Altbier.</p>
